        Learning to write in a language you’ve never used before can be extremely challenging — it often leaves you with more questions than answers. When I first started learning to code, AI tools didn’t exist. If I wanted to learn anything, I had to either find a book, search the internet, or take a class. I personally learn best when I can ask questions — not necessarily to get answers, but just to think out loud. Often, vocalizing what I’m dealing with helps me reach the conclusion myself. But without anyone to talk to, I didn’t realize that was how I processed things.

        When I first heard of AI, I was skeptical — why would I use it over something like Google? I gave it a shot one day, and it completely changed the way I learn. Sure, ChatGPT knows a lot, but more importantly, it let me talk through problems, explore my ideas, and think out loud with someone — or something — that wouldn’t judge or interrupt. If you’ve never heard of the rubber duck method, it’s when you explain your code to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) to debug it. For me, ChatGPT became my rubber duck, and it fast-tracked how I understood concepts and improved my thinking.

        Teachers exist to help you learn things like reading, writing, and more. But when there’s no teacher for what you want to learn — what then? Through AI, I could find answers instantly and, more importantly, become my own teacher. “How do I make text appear on screen?” “Why use a `;` instead of a `,`?” “How do I change text color?” I could ask anything and move at my own pace. My questions grew from basic to complex. If I didn’t understand something, I’d just keep asking. In school, teachers often capped how many questions I could ask — leaving me stuck, confused, and silent. With AI, I found something new: a learning tool with infinite patience. That alone changed everything. Everyone learns differently. I learn by asking questions.
