      <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">
        I started game development with no formal background ‚Äî just curiosity and the drive to learn how to build things that hadn&apos;t been created yet. When I was 16, I knew I wanted to make games and learn how to code, but I had no avenues for it in school. I turned to books and YouTube tutorials to learn my first bit of C# and Unity. Some time later, fueled by fantasy and passion, I made my first mistake of many: I started a Kickstarter.

        <br /><br />

        I&apos;ve made plenty of mistakes in my life, and I&apos;ll continue to make more ‚Äî but one thing I&apos;ve never done is give up or let them defeat me. I&apos;m not a genius or prodigy when it comes to traditional intelligence, but I do have patience and a will to persevere. Could I have moved through life faster or learned lessons more quickly? Sure. But I wouldn&apos;t have learned anything at all if I gave up when faced with the &quot;what-ifs.&quot; My path might look different, but it&apos;s mine ‚Äî and I own it.

        <br /><br />

        These days, I can ‚Äúspeak‚Äù Rust and I&apos;m learning TypeScript ‚Äî and I&apos;m only going to keep developing more skills. I&apos;ll also keep making mistakes and learning from them. Game jams, late nights, and trial-and-error is my groove, and I&apos;ve come to love it. My journey has had its ups and downs, but I feel like I&apos;m on a steady track forward. I feel blessed and fulfilled to be growing as a developer and getting closer to the dreams I&apos;ve held since I was a kid.
