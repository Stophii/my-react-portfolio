        I started game development with no formal background — just curiosity and the drive to learn how to build things that hadn't been created yet. When I was 16, I knew I wanted to make games and learn how to code, but I had no avenues for it in school. I turned to books and YouTube tutorials to learn my first bit of C# and Unity. Some time later, fueled by fantasy and passion, I made my first mistake of many: I started a Kickstarter.

        <br /><br />

        I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, and I’ll continue to make more — but one thing I’ve never done is give up or let them defeat me. I’m not a genius or prodigy when it comes to traditional intelligence, but I do have patience and a will to persevere. Could I have moved through life faster or learned lessons more quickly? Sure. But I wouldn't have learned anything at all if I gave up when faced with the "what-ifs." My path might look different, but it’s mine — and I own it.

        <br /><br />

        These days, I can “speak” Rust and I’m learning TypeScript — and I’m only going to keep developing more skills. I’ll also keep making mistakes and learning from them. Game jams, late nights, and trial-and-error is my groove, and I’ve come to love it. My journey has had its ups and downs, but I feel like I’m on a steady track forward. I feel blessed and fulfilled to be growing as a developer and getting closer to the dreams I’ve held since I was a kid.
