        I&apos;m Christopher Savary — but please, call me Stoph. I&apos;m a self-taught game developer, software developer, and computer specialist. I love robots — whether it&apos;s Armored Cores, Gundams, or Transformers, I&apos;m into all things mecha. I grew up with games and developed a deep passion for anything fantasy or game-related. Some of my favorite games include Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, Armored Core, and Final Fantasy. I&apos;m also into Warhammer and anything artistic that fuels my creativity.

        <br /><br />

        I work every day to grow — not just to meet my own expectations, but to provide for my growing family. My life has been eventful, filled with ups and downs, and at 27, I feel like I&apos;m learning life lessons a decade earlier than most. My dream is to create games that my loved ones — and the world — can enjoy. Technology and games have helped me see the magic in life, and I aim to channel that inspiration into everything I build. Sound, art, programming, fantasy, and creation — those are what I live for. My favorite color is white, and I love animals. If any of my work, words, or stories inspire you, I&apos;d genuinely love to hear it.

        This site is both a personal hub and a learning project — my first steps into TypeScript and React. Here, I share the games I&apos;ve made, blog about what I&apos;ve learned, and reflect on the creative process as I continue to grow.
